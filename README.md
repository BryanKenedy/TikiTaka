Hello!!

Here is my submission for the mobile tic tac toe game. During the assessment, I had to make some assumptions and ran into some constraints that I will explain below. 

Assumptions:
I assumed Player 1 to be X and Player 2 to be O. 
I also assumed that players may only start a new game after the current one has been completed. 


This project was created using expo, a react-native framework.



Thank you!
